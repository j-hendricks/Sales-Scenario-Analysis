# Sales-Scenario-Analysis
Used Power BI to plot the actual and projected sales over time

## Overview

This project visualizes sales data from a fictional company. The dataset was provided by DataCamp in their "Introduction to Power BI" course. Sales data is split into 3 categories: actual, budget, and forecast. The sales data was filtered based on this dimension, with a focus on the sales from the "actual" category.
