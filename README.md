# Sales-Scenario-Analysis
Used Power BI to plot the actual and projected sales over time

## Overview

This project visualizes sales data from a fictional company. The dataset was provided by DataCamp in their "Introduction to Power BI" course. Sales data is split into 3 categories: actual, budget, and forecast. The sales data was filtered based on this dimension, with a focus on the sales from the "actual" category.

Using the slicer to the right, we can filter by the year. The distribution of 2019 sales is very similar to that for all years.
